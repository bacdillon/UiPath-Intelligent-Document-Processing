The Document Understanding Framework is designed to help us combine different approaches to extract information from multiple documents, not necessarily with the same structure.

To decide which steps are needed for a specific business process, you will need to address the below requirements:
* Do we need only to classify the documents?
* Do we need to classify and extract data from documents?
* Who will be handling the manual verification when needed?
* How would you escalate verification needs to higher management?
* What is the basis of verification and escalation to management?

One primary concern of the solution is that it should not stop the entire process until a human performs a manual verification. The process should escalate the check to the respective party, while at the same time continuing to evaluate and process the rest of the documents.
